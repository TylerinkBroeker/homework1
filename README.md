# homework1

This is my finished Homework 1 assignment. In this assignment I went through an existing website code to clean it up to improve readability
of the page as well as changing the tags to improve accessability by making them semantic tags. I also added alt titles to the images
so that if they did not function for any reason there would still be a representation of the image. All of this is done without changing
the website look or function in any way.
